    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Obscura is an open source tool written in Java for processing OpenPGP formatted files.
    It is intended to ultimately support the full range of OpenPGP processing, for example
    similar to what GnuPG supports. However, the primary purpose of this project is educational.
    It is used in classes at Vermont Technical College as a source of samples, and of
    programming exercises and assignments.</para>

    <para>Obscura is mostly used in connection with the Secure Programming class at VTC as a
    vehicle for demonstrating the use of encryption technology in programs, and as a non-trivial
    program with its own security requirements.</para>
