Obscura
=======

Obscura is a Java program that implements the OpenPGP standard. It is intended primarly as a
source of exercises and assignments for students in my Secure Programming class at Vermont
Technical College (as well as possibly other classes). Thus its primary purpose is educational.
If and when the program evolves to a usable tool, the focus of this development effort may
change.
